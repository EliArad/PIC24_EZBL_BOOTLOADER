 *         image and proceed with erase/programming steps.
 *
 *         NOTE: When this callback is executed, the remote node (if applicable)
 *         is left waiting and will timeout if a response takes too long to
 *         arrive. To ensure a communications timeout does not occur, limit code
 *         in this callback to less than the remote node's communications
 *         timeout (typically around 1 second, but configurable and not
